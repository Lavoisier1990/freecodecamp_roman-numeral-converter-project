# freecodecamp_roman-numeral-converter-project

This is an adaptation of a short project with the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (Beta) track. It is a small project that converts Arabic numerals (conventional numerals) into Roman Numerals. The actual project required conversion until 3 999 and did not require conversion from Roman numerals to Arabic numerals. I will however attempt to allow conversion to 4 999 999, as it is apparently not possible to represent 5 million in the traditional Roman numeral system. I opted to give it some attractive styling to make it fun. Furthermore, I will attempt to allow conversion from Roman numerals to Arabic numerals. This was the initial submission, however, I intend on "cleaning" up the code, and adding functionality to it as I learn more.

**User Stories:**
1. You should have an input element with an id of "number".
2. You should have a button element with an id of "convert-btn".
3. You should have a div element with an id of output.
4. When you click on the #convert-btn element without entering a value into the #number element, the #output element should contain the text "Please enter a valid number".
5. When the #number element contains the number -1 and the #convert-btn element is clicked, the #output element should contain the text "Please enter a number greater than or equal to 1".
6. When the #number element contains the number 4000 or greater and the #convert-btn element is clicked, the #output element should contain the text "Please enter a number less than or equal to 3999".
7. When the #number element contains the number 9 and the #convert-btn element is clicked, the #output element should contain the text "IX".
8. When the #number element contains the number 16 and the #convert-btn element is clicked, the #output element should contain the text "XVI".
9. When the #number element contains the number 649 and the #convert-btn element is clicked, the #output element should contain the text "DCXLIX".
10. When the #number element contains the number 1023 and the #convert-btn element is clicked, the #output element should contain the text "MXXIII".
11. When the #number element contains the number 3999 and the #convert-btn element is clicked, the #output element should contain the text "MMMCMXCIX".
